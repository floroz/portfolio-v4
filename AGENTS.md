# Portfolio

This project is a simple website portfolio.

## Technologies

The project uses Node.js (via `fnm` to control the correct version)

run:

- `npm dev` to develop
- `npm lint` to lint
- `npm format` to format

We use React and Typescript

## After modifying a file

Always run `npm run format` at the end of your changes.

## Coding style

Never, ever use `any` unless instructed to do so. If you need to use `any` you need to add a comment with a comprehensive justification.
